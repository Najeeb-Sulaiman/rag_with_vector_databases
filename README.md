## Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of vector databases and generative AI by building a chatbot that can:
1. Ingest WhatsApp group chat messages.
2. Generate embeddings for the messages and store them in a vector database.
3. Use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer user questions based on the stored messages.
